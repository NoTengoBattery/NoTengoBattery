## About my software skills
I am very fluent in languages such as the Bourne Shell, C, Make, and Ruby. I have abilities with the Linux kernel, GNU/Linux, Embedded Linux, Electronics, UNIX-like operating systems, front-end, back-end, software design, networking, and more.

Also, I have experience with embedded tools like Buildroot, Clang, and GCC; and with frameworks such as Ruby on Rails.

## Thoughts about me
I define myself as a fast learner. If there is something that I can not handle at the time, I can quickly learn it. I can read the documentation, follow tutorials with criteria (that means: not blindly) and I know better by practicing.

I consider that the ability to teach yourself and to learn from your mistakes is one of the most valuable soft skills for a developer and engineer. Otherwise, the developer or engineer that stops learning will be quickly left behind.

I want technology to be reachable to anyone, no matter who they are, where they are, or what they do. Technology means progress, and bringing technology will, indubitably, bring improvement too. Advancement should not be prohibited or put behind a walled garden, it should be encouraged and bring freedom to people.

## Fun fact
If you don't speak Spanish, you are likely to pronounce my name, Oever, wrong. The correct pronunciation is `/o 'e ver/`
